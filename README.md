# PRODIGY_SD_02

Build a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program should prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. It should continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then display the number of attempts it took to win the game.

EXPLAINATION:
Random Number Generation: The program uses the Random class to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
User Input: The program uses a Scanner object to read the userâ€™s guesses.
Looping Until Correct Guess: A while loop is used to keep prompting the user for guesses until they guess the correct number.
Feedback: The program provides feedback whether the guess is too high or too low.
Counting Attempts: The program keeps track of the number of attempts it took for the user to guess the number correctly.
Ending the Game: Once the correct number is guessed, the program congratulates the user and displays the number of attempts.
